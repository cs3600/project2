Project 2
=========

#OUTLINE
This readme outlines what we have left to do for the project. At a later point this
will be updated to reflect what the project is about, the difficulties we faced,
what we've learned, etcetera.

#REFLECTION

#TOOLS

"./create_dir"
    use to create a 1000 block FS mounted at /tmp/NAME


#TODO

  - How should we handle "type" in DIRENT
  - Change pointers with stars to & in method signatures
  - Limit line length; line length = 80
  - Make sure tab indentation is consistent
  - Ensure that if conditions that are negated (!condition) work as expected (!1 != 0)
  - Logically order function declarations within each file
  - Ensure commenting is consistent, concise, and informative
  - File metadata (timestamps, users, groups) are incorrect

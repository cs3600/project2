Project 2
=========

Approach:


TODO:

Objects
  - How should we handle "type" in DIRENT
  - Change pointers with stars to & in method signatures
  - Limit line length; line length = 80
  - Make sure tab indentation is consistent
  - Ensure that if conditions that are negated (!condition) work as expected (!1 != 0)
  - Logically order function declarations within each file
  - Ensure commenting is consistent, concise, and informative
  - File metadata (timestamps, users, groups) are incorrect

3600fs (Milestone 2)
  - vfs_mount
  - vfs_create
  - vfs_delete
  - vfs_readdir
